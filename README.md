# Student AI Workflow

## Overview
This project is part of the **Microsoft Elevate Internship (December 2025 Batch)**.  
It extends a Power BI student marks dashboard into an **AI-powered workflow** using Python, Copilot, and Power Automate.  
The goal is to automate student performance analysis, generate predictions, and deliver insights through a modular, reproducible pipeline.

---

## Features
- Power BI dashboard with KPIs, grade distribution, and subject averages
- Student marks dataset (Excel) for rule-based and predictive analysis
- Python ML pipeline (scikit-learn) for pass/fail and grade prediction
- Copilot-generated insights and conditional formatting logic
- Power Automate workflow for automated reporting and refresh
- Organized folder structure for reproducibility and clarity

---

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `joblib`, `openpyxl`
- **Power BI Desktop**
- **Microsoft Power Automate**
- **Microsoft Copilot**

## How to Run

### 1. Set up environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate   # On Windows
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Train the model
```bash
python scripts/train_model.py
```

### 4. Run prediction pipeline
```bash
python scripts/run_pipeline.py
```

### 5. Open Power BI dashboard
- Navigate to `powerbi/Student_Marks_Result_Analysis_MS-ELEVATE_CO-PILOT_PROJECT_RISHIT-GHOSH.pbix`
- Click **Refresh** to load latest predictions

---

## Dashboard Pages

### 1. **Marks & Result Analysis**
- Rule-based evaluation of student marks
- KPIs: Total Students, Average Marks, Pass %, Top Scorer
- Visuals: Pass/Fail pie chart, subject averages, student table

### 2. **AI Predictions & Comparative Analysis**
- AI-driven predictions vs rule-based outcomes
- KPIs: Predicted Pass %, Average Overall Marks
- Visuals: Grade distribution, subject averages, pass % comparison
- Student-level prediction table with conditional formatting

---

## Notes
- Sample tables show 7–8 rows for layout clarity; full dataset is available in `data/processed/`
- Dashboard visuals are stored in `docs/screenshots/`
- Project authored by **Rishit Ghosh** as part of the **Microsoft Elevate Internship**

## Extras
### Notes on `pass_classifier.pkl`

The file `pass_classifier.pkl` is a **serialized machine learning model** created during training.  
It contains the logic and parameters of the classifier used to predict whether a student will **pass (1)** or **fail (0)** based on their marks.

- **How it’s created:**  
  Generated by running `train_model.py`, which trains the model using scikit-learn and saves it with `joblib` or `pickle`.

- **What it stores:**  
  - The chosen algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)  
  - Learned weights/parameters from the training dataset  
  - Any preprocessing steps included in the pipeline  

- **How it’s used:**  
  When you run `run_pipeline.py`, the `.pkl` file is loaded and applied to new student data to generate predictions (`Predicted_Pass`, `Predicted_Grade`).

Example usage:
```python
import joblib

# Load trained model
model = joblib.load('models/pass_classifier.pkl')

# Predict outcomes
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

This ensures consistency — the same trained model can be reused without retraining every time.
